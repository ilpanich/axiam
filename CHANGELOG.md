## [1.0.0-alpha] - 2026-07-15

First alpha release of AXIAM (Access eXtended Identity and Authorization
Management). This is an early, pre-production preview intended for evaluation
and feedback — APIs and data models may still change before the beta and
stable releases.

### Added

- **Multi-tenancy** — organizations as top-level entities containing fully
  data-isolated tenants; all domain entities (users, groups, roles,
  permissions, resources, certificates) are tenant-scoped.
- **Authentication** — username/password (Argon2id), MFA (TOTP), social login
  and certificate-based (mTLS) authentication; EdDSA (Ed25519) JWT access
  tokens with opaque, single-use, rotating refresh tokens.
- **Authorization** — additive, default-deny RBAC engine with role
  inheritance through hierarchical resources, scopes for sub-resource
  granularity, and group-inherited role assignments.
- **OAuth2 / OpenID Connect** — authorization server and OIDC provider
  (Authorization Code + PKCE, Client Credentials, Refresh Token).
- **Federation** — SAML SP and OpenID Connect federation for cross-domain SSO.
- **APIs** — REST (Actix-Web, OpenAPI-documented), gRPC (Tonic) for
  low-latency authz checks, and AMQP (Lapin) for async/deferred authz, audit
  ingestion and event notifications.
- **PKI** — per-tenant X.509 certificate management signed by an organization
  CA, with CA private keys encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM); GnuPG/OpenPGP
  integration for audit signing and encrypted data exports.
- **Auditing** — append-only audit logging.
- **Webhooks** — real-time event notifications to external systems, signed
  with HMAC-SHA256.
- **Admin frontend** — React + TypeScript administration UI.
- **Packaging & deployment** — multi-arch (amd64/arm64) container images and
  standalone server binaries, Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests.
- **Client SDKs** — Rust, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, PHP and Go SDKs, each
  released in its own repository against the shared API contract.
