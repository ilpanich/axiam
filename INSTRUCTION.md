## Key concepts
- User: A user is an individual who has an account in AXIAM and can authenticate and access resources based on their roles and permissions.
- Role: A role is a collection of permissions that can be assigned to users. Roles define what actions a user can perform and what resources they can access.
- Permission: A permission is a specific action that a user can perform on a resource. Permissions are defined within roles and can be assigned to users through their roles.
- Resource: A resource is an entity that users can access or interact with. Resources can be anything from a web application to a database or an API endpoint. Permissions are defined in relation to resources, specifying what actions can be performed on them; resources can be organized hierarchically, allowing for more granular control over access and permissions. Roles can be assigned permissions on specific resources, and users can be assigned roles that grant them access to those resources based on the defined permissions. Also some roles can be defined as "global", meaning that they grant permissions across all resources, while others can be resource-specific, granting permissions only for certain resources. This hierarchical organization of resources and the ability to define both global and resource-specific roles allows for a flexible and granular access control system within AXIAM. Roles on on resources can be inherited, meaning that if a user has a role on a parent resource, they can also have that role on its child resources, unless explicitly overridden. This inheritance mechanism simplifies the management of permissions across complex resource hierarchies and ensures consistent access control throughout the system. Additionally, AXIAM supports the concept of "scopes", which are used to define specific permissions within a resource. Scopes allow for even more granular control over what actions users can perform on resources, enabling fine-tuned access management based on specific use cases and requirements.
- Authentication: The process of verifying the identity of a user. AXIAM supports various authentication methods, including username/password, social login, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Authorization: The process of determining what actions a user is allowed to perform based on their roles and permissions. AXIAM provides a flexible authorization system that allows you to define roles and permissions, and assign them to users.
- OAuth2: An open standard for authorization that allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without sharing their credentials. AXIAM supports OAuth2 for secure authorization.
- OpenID Connect: An authentication layer built on top of OAuth2 that allows clients to verify the identity of users based on the authentication performed by an authorization server. AXIAM supports OpenID Connect for secure authentication and identity management.
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA): A security mechanism that requires users to provide multiple forms of authentication to verify their identity. AXIAM supports MFA to enhance the security of user accounts and protect against unauthorized access.
- Service accounts: Service accounts are special types of accounts that are used for automated processes and applications to authenticate and access resources without human intervention. AXIAM supports service accounts, allowing you to create and manage them for various use cases, such as API access, background jobs, and integration with other systems. Service accounts can be assigned roles and permissions just like regular user accounts, enabling fine-grained control over their access to resources and actions they can perform within the AXIAM system.

## Technologies
- Rust: AXIAM is built using Rust, a systems programming language known for its performance, safety, and concurrency. Rust's memory safety features help prevent common programming errors, making AXIAM more secure and reliable.
- SurrealDB: AXIAM uses SurrealDB, a distributed database that provides high performance and scalability. SurrealDB is designed to handle large volumes of data and can be deployed in a distributed environment, making it suitable for AXIAM's needs for managing user data, roles, permissions, and other related information.
- OpenAPI: AXIAM provides a RESTful API that is documented using OpenAPI specifications. This allows developers to easily understand and integrate with the API, enabling seamless communication between AXIAM and other applications or services.
- AMQP: AXIAM can use AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) for asynchronous communication between different components of the system. This allows for decoupling of services and enables efficient handling of tasks such as user authentication, authorization decisions, and audit logging in a distributed environment. Also AMQP can be used to perform authorization requests asynchronously, allowing for better performance and scalability in scenarios where authorization decisions may involve complex logic or interactions with external systems. By using AMQP, AXIAM can ensure that authorization requests are processed efficiently and reliably, even under high load or in distributed environments.
- gRPC: AXIAM can use gRPC, a high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework, for communication between different services or components within the system. gRPC allows for efficient and scalable communication, making it suitable for microservices architectures where different services need to interact with each other. By using gRPC, AXIAM can enable seamless communication between its various components, such as the backend API, authentication service, authorization service, and audit logging service, ensuring that they can work together effectively to provide a robust identity and access management solution. Also gRPC can be used to provide a more efficient and performant API for clients that require low latency and high throughput, such as mobile applications or IoT devices, allowing them to interact with AXIAM's authentication and authorization services in a more efficient manner. gRPC data can be serialized using Protocol Buffers, which provides a compact and efficient format for transmitting data between services, further enhancing the performance of AXIAM's communication between its components and clients.
- Docker: AXIAM can be deployed using Docker, a containerization platform that allows for easy deployment and management of applications. Docker provides a consistent environment for running AXIAM, making it easier to deploy and scale the application across different environments, such as development, staging, and production. With Docker, you can create and manage containers for AXIAM, ensuring that it runs consistently regardless of the underlying infrastructure, and simplifying the deployment process while also enabling efficient resource utilization and scalability.
