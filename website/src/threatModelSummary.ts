Nine of the eleven pipelines carry no long-lived registry credential: Rust, TypeScript, Python and C# and the shared axiam-opaque core publish via Trusted Publishing (OIDC); PHP through Packagist's webhook; Go, Swift, C and C++ from git tags. Every release workflow in the fleet now pins its actions by commit digest, and every published artifact — the server's binary tarballs and CycloneDX SBOMs, the container images, and each SDK's release artifacts — carries a GitHub build-provenance attestation, so an integrator can verify build origin with `gh attestation verify`. Maven Central (Java, Kotlin) still requires a stored Portal user token: Central has no trusted-publishing equivalent, and its OIDC surfaces are account sign-in and Sigstore signing, neither of which authorises an upload — see claude_dev/maven-central-publishing-decision.md. Those two are bounded by compensating controls instead: the credential is an environment secret behind a required-reviewer GitHub environment restricted to v* tags, every published file carries a Sigstore bundle (`.sigstore.json`) alongside its PGP signature — keyless, signed against the release workflow's GitHub OIDC identity and validated by the Central Publisher Portal, so the artifact set Central itself serves carries a statement of build origin the Portal token cannot forge — and the token rotates quarterly. A pull-request gate in each of those two repositories performs a real keyless signing run of the real artifact set on every change, so a release-path misconfiguration surfaces on a pull request rather than at a tag. Open because a stored bearer credential still exists for two of eleven registries."

The tooling is shaped to help, and since H-4 it CHECKS rather than merely advises: just vault-status queries sys/capabilities-self and reports the capabilities the token in hand actually holds on AXIAM's KV path, flagging anything beyond read — and a root token as what it is — with --strict to make it a failure in a deployment smoke test. It still reports secret presence only, never a value, and the seeder never rewrites a secret that already exists. Since 1.0.0-beta10 the token is no longer strictly read-only: it holds `read` on the startup path and `create`/`update` on `secret/data/axiam/ca-keys/*`, from the one policy file `docker/vault/axiam-policy.hcl`, and `just vault-status` reports missing capabilities as well as excess ones (T-232). Since 2026-09-12 (R-5) three more secrets sit behind that one credential — the datastore username and password and the broker URL, moved off the container spec to close T-132's follow-up — which widens exactly the concentration this entry records rather than narrowing it, and is the honest trade: a credential in a pod spec is readable by anyone with `get pod`, while a credential behind Vault is readable by whoever holds the token and revocable after the fact. The policy needed no change, because it grants `read` on the path rather than on fields."

   "residualRisk": "Narrowed, not closed. `prod-up` now writes the read-only `axiam` policy from `docs/deployment/vault.md` §5.4 and issues a **scoped, periodic token** for the server, refusing to fall back to root if that fails; seeding keeps its own short-lived credential, because the seeding token and the serving token were never the same thing. Both the Compose stack and `k8s/vault/statefulset.yml` move from the `file` backend to **Raft**, which has a consistent backup story (`vault operator raft snapshot save`) and a migration path to three nodes that does not require a re-seed — a re-seed changes the OPAQUE setup key, i.e. a password reset for every user in every tenant. What remains **open** is auto-unseal, which cannot be closed from inside AXIAM: every Vault OSS seal type needs a cloud KMS or a second Vault elsewhere, and `pkcs11` is Enterprise-only, so a TPM is not an option whatever the hardware. `docs/deployment/vault.md` §5.3 and the Pi runbook §7.1 give the honest option table — GCP Cloud KMS at roughly $0.06 per key per month is the cheapest real answer — and state plainly that a deployment which configures none of them needs a human with three shares after every restart and is not production. A script that unseals from shares kept on the machine is explicitly **not** offered as an alternative: it removes the seal rather than automating it, and is strictly worse than Shamir because the shares are now in the one place an attacker already has. Two amendments since: the server's token is no longer strictly read-only — it holds `create`/`update` on the CA-key prefix, from the one policy file (T-232) — and the seeder that runs after unseal can no longer mistake a refused read for an empty Vault and mint fresh keys over the live ones (T-231). Vault itself runs unprivileged: the prod Compose stack chowns the Raft volume in a one-shot init container rather than running the process that holds every secret as root. Made **checkable** in 1.0.0-beta12 (R-7), the way H-4 made T-180's token scope checkable. `just vault-status` gains a Seal section from the unauthenticated `sys/seal-status` — so it answers even when the token is wrong and even when the Vault is sealed: it names the seal type, reads `OK` for any auto-unseal type, and for `shamir` says \"no auto-unseal; every restart needs t of n key shares, not production\" with the quorum quoted from the response. A Vault sealed at that instant gets its own line, because that is a state somebody is about to fix rather than a statement about the configured seal, and conflating the two would train an operator to ignore both; a request that fails reports `unknown`, never `OK`. `--strict` fails on an unconfirmed auto-unseal, and `just vault-status` still does not pass it so the dev stack's deliberate root-token-on-Shamir does not turn every local run red. **Status stays Open**: the control is a check, not a seal — nothing in this repository can configure auto-unseal, and R-7 does not pretend otherwise."
